    "description": "Explanation of the differences between recursive and iterative approaches, including their use cases, advantages, and disadvantages.",
    "detailedExplanation": "In programming, recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem, whereas iteration repeatedly executes a set of instructions until a condition is met. Recursion is more intuitive for problems like tree traversal, while iteration is often preferred for its simplicity and efficiency in loops. However, recursion can lead to stack overflow issues with large inputs, making iteration a safer choice in some cases.",
